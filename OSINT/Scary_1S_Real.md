**Description**: It was a cold, rainy evening when cybersecurity analyst Alex received a mysterious message. The subject line read: "Can you find me?" Intrigued, Alex opened the email to find a single clue: a username- **sc4ryb0lt**

Found a user on `Github` using the same username.

This leaded to a [twitter](https://x.com/b0ltsc4ry) account.
